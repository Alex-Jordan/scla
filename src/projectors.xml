    <p>When we multiply a vector by a matrix, we form a linear combination of the columns of the matrix.  Said differently, the result of the product is in the column space of the matrix.  So we can think of a matrix as moving a vector into a subspace, and we call that subspace the column space of the matrix <m>\csp{A}</m>.  In the case of a linear transformation, we call this subspace the range, <m>\rng{T}</m>, or we might call it the image.  A <term>projector</term> is a square matrix which moves vectors into a subspace (like any matrix can), but fixes vectors already in the subspace.  This property earns a projector the moniker <term>idempotent</term>.  We will see that projectors have a variety of interesting properties.</p>

        <p>When the null space of a projector has dimension one, it is easy to understand the choice of the term <q>projector</q>.  Imagine the setting in three dimensions where the column space of the projector is a subspace of dimension two, which is physically a plane through the origin.  Imagine some vector as an arrow from the origin, or as just the point that would be at the tip of the arrow.  A light shines on the vector and casts a shadow onto the plane (either another arrow, or just a point).   This shadow is the projection, the image of the projector.  The image of the shadow is unchanged, since shining the light on the vector that is the shadow will not move it.  What direction does the light come from?  What is the vector that describes the change from the vector to its shadow (projection)?  For a vector<m>\vect{x}</m>, this direction is <m>P\vect{x}-\vect{x}</m>, an element of the null space of <m>P</m>.  So if <m>\nsp{P}</m> has dimension one, then every vector is moved in the same direction, a multiple of a lone basis vector for <m>\nsp{P}</m>.  This matches our assumptions about physical light from a distant source, with rays all moving parallel to each other.  Here is a simple example of just this scenario.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-projector-three-dimensions">
            <title>Projector in Three Dimensions</title>

            <p>Verify the following facts about the matrix <m>P</m> to understand that it is a projector and to understand its geometry.  <me>P = \frac{1}{13}
            \begin{bmatrix}<![CDATA[
            11 & -3 & -5 \\
            -4 & 7 & -10 \\
            -2 & -3 & 8
            ]]>\end{bmatrix}</me></p>

            <ol>
                <li><p><m>P^2=P</m></p></li>
                <li><p><m>\csp{P}=\spn{\set{\colvector{1\\0\\\frac{-2}{5}},\,\colvector{0\\1\\\frac{-3}{5}}}}</m></p></li>
                <li><p><m>\nsp{P}=\spn{\set{\colvector{1\\2\\1}}}</m></p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>So <m>P</m> sends every vector onto a two-dimensional subspace, with an equation we might write as <m>2x+3y+5z=0</m> in Cartesian coordinates, or which we might describe as the plane through the origin with normal vector <m>\vect{n}=2\vec{i}+3\vec{j}+5\vec{k}</m>.  Vectors, or points, are always moved in the direction of the vector <m>\vect{d}=\vec{i}+2\vec{j}+1\vec{k}</m><mdash />this is the direction the light is shining.

        <p>Given a projector, we can define a complementary projector, which has some interesting properties.</p>

                <p>Using Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="lemma-complementary-projector-column-space" /> again, <m>\nsp{P}=\csp{I-P}</m>.

        <p>There is an easy recipe for creating orthogonal projectors onto a given subspace.  We will first informally motivate the construction, then give the formal proof.  Suppose <m>U</m> is a subspace with a basis <m>\vectorlist{u}{k}</m> and let <m>A</m> be a matrix with these basis vectors as the columns.  Let <m>P</m> denote the desired orthogonal projector, and consider its action on an arbitrary vector <m>\vect{x}</m>.  To project onto <m>U</m>, we must have <m>P\vect{x}\in\csp{A}</m>, so there is a vector <m>\vect{w}</m> such that <m>P\vect{x}=A\vect{w}</m>.  The orthogonality condition will be satisfied if <m>P\vect{x}-\vect{x}</m> is orthogonal to every vector of <m>U</m>.
