    <title>LU (Triangular) Decomposition</title>
    
    <p>The <term>LU decomposition</term> begins with any matrix and describes it as a product of a lower-triangular matrix (<m>L</m>) and an upper-triangular matrix (<m>U</m>).  Hence the customary shorthand name, <q>LU</q>.  The term <term>triangular decomposition</term> might be more evocative, if not more verbose.</p>
    
    <p>You will notice that the LU decomposition feels very much like reduced row-echelon form, and in some ways could be considered an improvement.  Triangular matrices are defined in Subsection <xref acro="OD.TM" type="subsection" /> and two basic facts are that the product of two triangular matrices <q>of the same type</q> (<ie /> both upper or both lower) is again of that type (Theorem <xref acro="PTMT" type="theorem" />) and the inverse of a nonsingular triangular matrix will be triangular of the same type (Theorem <xref acro="ITMT" type="theorem" />).</p>
